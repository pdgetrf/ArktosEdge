# Centaurus Edge Design

## Abstract
The prosperity of cloud technologies, 5G and AI brings vast opportunities for edge computing where computation migrates from centralized data centers to on-prem, at-home, and remote areas. This document introduces a novel edge-computing framework design for Centaurus. Observing and honoring the requirements specific to edge environments, e.g. low latency, high survivability, and hierarchically distributed architecture, this design features 
1. running clusters on the edge, alongside with edge nodes,
2. flexible topologies where edge clusters are connected in multi-layer tree-like structures, which allows connectivity fluctuation tolerance and easy layered management, 
3. flexible flavored clusters on the edge, such as K8s and K3s, 
4. inter-cluster communication capability and, 
5. smart edge cluster formation. 

## Scenarios

- IoT
- Smart Factory
- MEC

## Requirements

Tolerance to 

1. Network Disconnect

2. Edge Node Failutre

3. Both 1. and 2. Simultaneously
